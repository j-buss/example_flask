# Deploying Flask Apps into Google Cloud Platform

There are many Flask tutorials online that describe the details of using the lightweight Python framework Flask. With this very short series I am focused on 
getting a minimal Flask app deployed to Google Cloud Platform and using data from BigQuery.

## Part 2: Read BigQuery

Let's take our simple Flask app from the last post and add in some database access to BigQuery. Before we have to deal with keys and passwords we will use one of the public 
datasets that is accessible to all.

### 1. Add in the BigQuery Hooks:
### 2. Test it locally
### 3. Test it on GCP

#### Tutorials
- [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
 : The Flask Tutorial Gold Standard. In a clear and consistent format it walks you through all the basics and well into the intermediate range.
 Not only that, but the tutorial is a delight to work through. 
 The author Miguel Grinberg writes in a way that it is a pleasure to follow along. 
 His love of Flask and Python are evident.
- [Your First Flask App](https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application/) is a series of posts which describe many facets of Flask.
The series includes blueprints, Jinja and SQLAlchemy. It is not intended to be a step-by-step tutorial, but instead describes the concepts in a very 
conversational way.
- [Deploying a Python Flask Web Application to App Engine Flexible](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-vision-app-engine/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0)
is a Google Cloud Codelabs walk-through describing each of the steps to deploy a vision app from Google's Github repository:
